===Adding to the main library===

  # Setup DIYLC project. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/source/checkout this guide] to learn how to checkout the project from the source control.
  # New components should be created inside *org.diylc.components* package of *src.library* folder.
  # When you are done developing and testing the new components, build the *src.library* folder as *library/main.jar*.
  # Commit new classes to the source control.
  # Commit the updated library/main.jar back to the source control.

===Creating your own component library===

  # Create a new Java project.
  # Add *diylc.jar* to the dependencies.
  # Since it's your own project, you can use whichever package name you like.
  # When you are done developing and testing the new components, build your project as *library/`<`myLibraryName`>`.jar*.
  # To add your components to the DIYLC project by building your project into a jar and committing it to *library* folder in the DIYLC source control. It should be automatically recognized by the app.
