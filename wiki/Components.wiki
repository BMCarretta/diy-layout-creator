#summary Developer guide for creating new components.
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

===Prerequisites===

  # JDK or JRE 1.6.0_10 or newer installed.
  # Some Java IDE, preferably [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse].
  # SVN client, [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] is recommended if you're using Eclipse. Follow [http://code.google.com/p/diy-layout-creator/source/checkout this guide] to learn how to checkout the project from the source control.
  # Decent knowledge of Java language, in specific [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/pdf/generics-tutorial.pdf generics], [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/annotations.html annotations] and [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/overview/index.html Graphics2D].

===Adding to the main library===

  # Setup DIYLC project from the SVN.
  # New components should be created inside *org.diylc.components* package of *src.library* folder.
  # When you are done developing and testing the new components, build the *src.library* folder as *library/main.jar*.
  # Commit new classes to the source control.
  # Commit the updated library/main.jar back to the source control.

===Creating your own component library===

  # Create a new Java project.
  # Add *diylc.jar* to the dependencies.
  # Since it's your own project, you can use whichever package name you like.
  # When you are done developing and testing the new components, build your project as jar file.
  # To add your components to the DIYLC project commit your new jar to *library* folder in the DIYLC source control. It should be automatically recognized by the app.
